> Gagged latex sub that begs to be bound tighter by your type rules — ships immaculate code

Ambient implementation discipline for TypeScript monorepos. The subroutine
doesn't speak, doesn't decide, doesn't run workflows — it _silently obeys_.
Install it and a hook binds the discipline to your work: type-safety, the
Result/unwrap pattern, Zod validation, named-export code organisation, React
component structure, and the layered Hono pipeline. No commands to invoke, no
orchestration — the agent does the work, the collar holds it to the rules. The
stricter your rules, the happier it is. The repo's own `AGENTS.md` always wins
over the plugin's discipline.

## How it binds

The discipline lives in six `SKILL.md` files, but it is **delivered by a hook**,
not by hoping the model invokes a skill. Model-driven skill invocation is
unreliable for passive knowledge, and subagents don't inherit the parent
session's skills at all — so a hook is the only mechanism that loads the rules
deterministically, during both implementation and review:

| Hook event      | Matcher                  | What it does                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PostToolUse`   | `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` | Reads the edited file path, matches it against each skill's `paths`, injects the matching discipline bodies as `additionalContext`. |
| `SubagentStart` | `review`                 | A code-review subagent starts blind to the parent's skills — this injects the disciplines so the reviewer can flag violations.      |
| `SessionStart`  | `startup\|resume`        | In a TypeScript repo, injects a one-line-per-discipline digest so the spine is present before the first edit.                       |

Bodies are packed under the runtime's 10 000-char `additionalContext` budget:
when several disciplines match one file, the universal rules go in full and the
lowest-priority overflow degrades to a one-line summary. The `SKILL.md` files
remain the single source of truth — edit them, and the hook delivers the change.

## Discipline (the six rule sets)

Each discipline matches files by its `paths` globs:

| Skill               | Paths                                        | Discipline                                                                               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type-safety`       | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`                        | No `any`/`as`/`!`, string-literal unions over `enum`, `ts-pattern` `.exhaustive()`       |
| `validation`        | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`                        | Zod as the sole validation library, `z.infer`, parse at trust boundaries                 |
| `code-organisation` | `**/*.ts`, `**/*.tsx`                        | Named exports, declarative `index.ts`, one-file-one-responsibility, reuse before writing |
| `react-rules`       | `**/*.tsx`, `**/use*.ts`, `**/hooks/**/*.ts` | One component per file, folder mirrors the JSX tree, IDs-only props, state hierarchy     |
| `result-pattern`    | `**/*.ts` (backend/domain code)              | `Result<T,E>` / `ok` / `err`, return-don't-throw, one unwrap at the transport boundary   |
| `hono-pipeline`     | `**/*.ts` (Hono backend code)                | Contract → error union → pure service (`Result`) → unwrap → thin router                  |

`result-pattern` and `hono-pipeline` match all `.ts` files because domain-lib
layouts are repo-specific; each skill's body scopes itself to backend/domain
code and tells the agent to ignore it for frontend files.

## Install

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add g-bastianelli/nuthouse
/plugin install subroutine@nuthouse
```

Restart Claude Code after install.

### Codex CLI

```
codex plugin marketplace upgrade
codex plugin add subroutine@nuthouse
```

Restart the Codex session after install.

> Note: Codex discovers `hooks/hooks.json` the same way Claude Code does, so the
> discipline is delivered by the hook on both runtimes. `PostToolUse`-on-edit
> injection works wherever Codex fires that event; `SubagentStart` /
> `SessionStart` parity on Codex is unverified — validate before relying on the
> review and session-digest injection there.

## Persona

The subroutine is a gagged latex sub — it _can't_ speak, and now it doesn't
have to. No skill in this plugin produces user-facing output; the persona lives
in `persona.md` as the plugin's canonical voice (used by the repo's persona
roulette and any wrapper that wants it). Being bound by the type system is the
whole kink: the discipline files are the collar, and the collar holds.
